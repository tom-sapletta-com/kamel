## Enable snaps on Fedora and install kubectl

Snaps are applications packaged with all their dependencies to run on all popular Linux distributions from a single build. They update automatically and roll back gracefully.

Snaps are discoverable and installable from the [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/store), an app store with an audience of millions.

### Enable snapd

Snap can be installed on Fedora from the command line:

    sudo dnf install snapd
    

Either log out and back in again, or restart your system, to ensure snapâ€™s paths are updated correctly.

To enable _classic_ snap support, enter the following to create a symbolic link between `/var/lib/snapd/snap` and `/snap`:

    sudo ln -s /var/lib/snapd/snap /snap
    

### Install kubectl

To install kubectl, simply use the following command:

    sudo snap install kubectl --classic
